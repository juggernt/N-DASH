## N-DASH: Novo Holding, Mining & Node Dashboard

N-DASH is a lightweight, responsive, web-based user interface for Novo 
users who run a wallet, node, witnessing, mining account, or all of the above on 
a Linux or unix server (i.e. a Raspberry Pi). Using this dashboard users can keep 
an eye on their Novo server and control their nodes, holding and mining 
account(s) without the need of a terminal. It also includes the option to 
control a Novo wallet.

This dashboard is created with the idea to keep everything as simple as 
possible, so even people who are not very good with computers or don't 
understand how to set up a holding account can use this functionality 
of Novo. Of course, new ideas and comments are always welcome. You can
